# Data Science web with Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a platform that solves many of the problems associated with creating a website about data science, where the intention is to use different programming languages such as Python, SQL, R, and mathematical equations with $\LaTeX$.

# Theme

# Branding

### Find an available domain

### Design an icon

### Design an favicon\*\*:

A *favicon* is a small icon associated with a website. Favicons are displayed in
the browser's address bar, next to the page title, and in the browser's tabs.
There are websites where you can create you own favicon from an image:
https://realfavicongenerator.net/

To add a favicon to the Quarto website, you need to modify the `_quarto.yml`
file as follows:"

```         
website:
  favicon: favicon.png
```
