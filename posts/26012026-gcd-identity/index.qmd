## Statement

Let $$n \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$k \in \mathbb{N},\ k \ge 1.$$ Then

$$
\gcd\bigl(n, (n+1)(n+2)\cdots(n+k)\bigr)
= \gcd(n, k!).
$$

Equivalently, using the rising factorial (Pochhammer symbol),

$$
\gcd\bigl(n, \operatorname{Pochhammer}(n+1,k)\bigr) = \gcd(n,k!).
$$

## Notation and preliminaries

- For a prime $$p,$$ let $$v_p(m)$$ denote the *p-adic valuation* of an integer $$m,$$ i.e. the largest exponent $$e$$ such that $$p^e \mid m.$$
- For any integers $$a,b,$$

$$
v_p(\gcd(a,b)) = \min\bigl(v_p(a), v_p(b)\bigr).
$$

- Equality of two positive integers is equivalent to equality of their $$p$$-adic valuations for every prime $$p$$.

## Key lemma

**Lemma.** For every prime $$p,$$

$$
v_p\left(\prod_{i=1}^k (n+i)\right) = v_p(k!).
$$

### Proof of the lemma

Fix a prime $$p$$ and a positive integer $$r.$$

Observe that

$$
n+i \equiv i \pmod{p^r}.
$$

Therefore, for each $$r \ge 1,$$ the number of integers among

$$
n+1, n+2, \dots, n+k
$$

that are divisible by $$p^r$$ is exactly the same as the number of integers among

$$
1, 2, \dots, k
$$

that are divisible by $$p^r.$$

By definition of the $$p$$-adic valuation, this implies

$$
v_p\left(\prod_{i=1}^k (n+i)\right) = \sum_{r \ge 1} \left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^r} \right\rfloor = v_p(k!).
$$

This proves the lemma. $$\square$$

## Proof of the main theorem

We compute the $$p$$-adic valuation of both sides.

Let $$p$$ be an arbitrary prime. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_p\left(\gcd\bigl(n, \prod_{i=1}^k (n+i)\bigr)\right)
&= \min\left(v_p(n), v_p\left(\prod_{i=1}^k (n+i)\right)\right) \\
&= \min\bigl(v_p(n), v_p(k!)\bigr) \\
&= v_p\bigl(\gcd(n,k!)\bigr).
\end{aligned}
$$

Since this equality holds for every prime $$p,$$ the two integers have identical prime factorizations. Hence

$$
\gcd\bigl(n, (n+1)(n+2)\cdots(n+k)\bigr) = \gcd(n,k!).
$$

$$\square$$

## Remarks

1. Only primes $$p \le k$$ can divide the gcd; primes larger than $$k$$ cannot divide any of $$n+1,\dots,n+k.$$
2. The proof explains why the result is independent of $$n$$ modulo primes larger than $$k.$$
3. This argument aligns exactly with computer algebra behavior: symbolic `GCD` simplifies correctly, while `FactorInteger` requires numeric specialization.

## Equivalent formulation

Using the Pochhammer symbol,

$$
\operatorname{Pochhammer}(n+1,k) = (n+1)(n+2)\cdots(n+k),
$$

so the identity may be written as

$$
\boxed{\gcd\bigl(n, \operatorname{Pochhammer}(n+1,k)\bigr) = \gcd(n,k!)}.
$$
