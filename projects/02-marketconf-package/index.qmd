# Package marketconf: Stock Market Confidence Indexes

The R package `marketconf` reads data on **U. S. Stock Market Confidence
Indexes** from the [Yale School of Management's International Center for
Finance](https://som.yale.edu/faculty-research/our-centers-initiatives/international-center-finance/data/stock-market-confidence)
web page.

This package is designed for stock market prediction and risk valuation,
and it is compatible with other packages like:

[`quantmod`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/index.html),
[`TTR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TTR/index.html) or
[`tidyquant`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/index.html)

## Package installation

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("EnriquePH/marketconf")
```

## Examples

### Listing confidence indices

The four U.S. stock market confidence indices are derived monthly from
survey data on investors' behavior. These indices are:

```{r}
#| label: list indices
library(marketconf)
library(knitr)
kable(US_confidence_indices()[c(1, 3, 4)])
```

### Plotting

This is a basic example that plots the **U.S. Valuation Confidence Index**:

```{r}
#| label: example
library(ggplot2)

index_symbol <- "USVI"
index_df <- get_index(index_symbol)

ggplot(index_df, aes(x = Date, y = USVI.Value, color = Investor)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle(get_index_description(index_symbol))
```
