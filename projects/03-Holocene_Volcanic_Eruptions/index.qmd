# Volcanic Eruptions in the Holocene Period

## Data source

The [Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP)](https://volcano.si.edu/) documents Earth’s volcanoes and their eruptive history. The _Volcanoes of the World_ database is a catalog of Holocene and Pleistocene volcanoes, as well as eruptions from the past 12,000 years in the Holocene period. The GVP database includes the names, locations, types, and features of more than 1,500 volcanoes that have erupted during the Holocene period or are currently exhibiting signs of unrest.

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Notebook

This notebook processes GVP data by simplifying the main variables. It also tests various map plotting systems in R to effectively visualize and explore the data.
